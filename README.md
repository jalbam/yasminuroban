## Description

Open source Sokoban (aka Warehouse keeper) version totally written in DHTML (HTML, CSS and JavaScript). With level editor.

It is my fourth DHTML game and was made in early 2006.

The game includes a level editor and, as far as I know, it is the first level editor ever made using JavaScript. It allows you to modify the current level or create a new one to play it after you press the "Play map" option. You can also copy the generated JavaScript code which can be used to modify the game code by yourself, for example.

You can also change the game behaviour or add new levels easily by editing many of the configuration variables which are at the beginning of the script. To change the game images you just need to replace them with others.

Official languages are Spanish and English.

You can find other modified and adapted versions of this game on the Internet (with configurable skins or themes and with many sets of levels that the player can choose), including one Opera widget.

This game has been tested under BeOS, Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Windows, Mac OS X and others.
